Using genomic and chemical data from freshwater chronosequences in Arctic Svalbard and Alpine Norway to study the functional and taxonomic succession of the microbiome upon glacial retreat. This repository includes slurm scripts to run Squeezemeta https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta on our system (https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/saga.html) for metagenomic analyses (raw data processing, assmebly and annotation, and binning) as well as amplicon analysis using dada2 (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2). Additional scripts are to perform statistics and visualization of the data in R.
